# Capstone Project
This project is made for 2244 INFSCI 1740 SEC1200.
The project is a small game/demo of an action roguelike game with the purpose of learning the Godot game engine and fulfilling capstone requirements.

This project will create a file within the %appdata%/Godot/app_userdata folder for the purpose of saving keybindings that are used.

All art assets are created by me as well.
